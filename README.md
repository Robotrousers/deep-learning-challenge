### Challenge 21 Neural Networks and Deep Learning
###  deep-learning-challenge
#### Using your knowledge of Pandas and scikit-learn’s StandardScaler(), you’ll need to preprocess the dataset. This step prepares you for Step 2, where you'll compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

### Challenge Guidelines:

### Proposed Technologies:
```yaml
scikit-learn: StandardScaler()
Python: Jupyter Notebook, pandas
```

### This repo contains the following files:
